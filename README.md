My public scratchpad: A collection of exercises that let me try out new languages, frameworks, or disciplines.

A <a href="http://codekata.com/">code kata</a> is a practice exercise for programmers (sometimes they don't even involve code).  <a href="http://simpleprogrammer.com/2013/08/26/dont-code-katas/">Not everyone agrees</a> that katas are a good idea.  I think they're worth doing now and then - as a rule, I want every practice session to focus on learning one new thing.  That could mean:

- A problem I've never solved
- A problem I have solved in a language I haven't used
- A problem I've solved in a language I've used but with a framework I want to learn

...and so on.
