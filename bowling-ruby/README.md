I hadn't written any ruby for a while, so I wrote a bowling scorer (inspired by, but not following, <a href="http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheBowlingGameKata">Uncle Bob's kata</a>) to brush up.  My TDD was pretty terrible here - in particular, writing the perfect game as an early test made me write more 'production' code than I should have.
